This is the first time that I, me, want to do something about coding.

It's a big decision, maybe I will work like a software engineer, and one day I will study computer science, have a CS master degree.

I can't imagine the future,  but I do believe I can hold the future, just like Xu says "The path taken by all the people in this world will be one of the ways taken by me."
